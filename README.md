**For more details about other starter kits for Compute@Edge, see the [Fastly developer hub](https://developer.fastly.com/solutions/starters)**

## Understanding the code

This starter is intentionally lightweight, and requires no dependencies aside from the [`"fastly-php-runtime-tool"`](github.com/bbutkovic/fastly-php-runtime-tool). 
It will help you understand the basics of processing requests at the edge using Fastly.
